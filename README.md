AIMS (Automated Induction Microfluidics System)

General Description : 
- AIMS is a digital microfluidics automation system that is able to read 
the absorbance of a droplet. It is advised to read the matGUI Tutorial first (in the Automation repository)
and then read the AIMS Tutorial. 

Description of the files : 

- (matGUI code AIMS.zip) 
The main code to run the matGUI program
system and the AIMS system.

- (AIMS Tutorial.zip)
Folder which contains a README file which explains how to operate the AIMS 
system. It also contains a short video that can be viewed as reference to 
the README file. 

- (AIMS3D.stl)
A stl file that is used to 3D print the whole physical setup required 
by the AIMS system.
